Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A) Because that may cause conflicts between my repository and github repository.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A) Fork is used to import repository from someone else's repository. It is a copy, which means you can do whatever you want with it. Clone is for downloading a repository to your local computer. Branch is another version of your repository. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

A) Later on, when you try to merge the two, the copy allows you to identify whether origin/master and (local) master are in sync or are our of sync
